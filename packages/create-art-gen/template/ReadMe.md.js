const readme = `# Code Art!

Add your code in the \`src/art.js\` file! It helps to under stand the canvas element but not super necessary. You can use any of the helpers available in \`@fionoble/art-gen-utils\`.

See docs here!

If you need some insipration look at some of the examples! You can even copy some of these files and use them as a starting point! 

Mess around and have fun! It won't be perfect on the first go and that's the point! Keep trying until you make something you like. Feel free to share your stuff with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/fionoble).
